change so can add css to existing, via render_kw and __call__()
    ex submit = SubmitField("Submit", render_kw={"class_":"btn-primary"})
    but this keeps "btn"

make Label for submit, hidden, csrf return ""
    to make forms more generic

have option to output container, label, and field all at once

figure out validation
    add "is-valid" class if raw_data is not none, and has validators
    add "is-invalid" class if raw_data is not none and has errors
    show green if no validators?

check:
    FormField
    FieldList(StringField)
    FieldList(FormField(...))

figure out InputGroups
    use FormField?

make container for BooleanField, like RadioField?

other frameworks like bulma require custom wrapper for components
    would want to change their widgets
