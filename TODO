radios are pretty wonky...

ur various widgets should set is-valid/is-invalid on container
    so that displays errors below

change so can add css to label.__call__()

have option to output container, label, and field all at once - maybe

check:
    FormField
    FieldList(StringField)
    FieldList(FormField(...))

figure out InputGroups
    meh, just do in template

make container for BooleanField, like RadioField? meh

other frameworks like bulma require custom wrapper for components
    would want to change their widgets
    
x figure out validation
    add "is-valid" class if raw_data is not none, and has validators
    add "is-invalid" class if raw_data is not none and has errors
    show green if no validators?

x change so can add css to existing, via Field("name", render_kw={}) and __call__(class_=...)
    ex submit = SubmitField("Submit", render_kw={"class_":"btn-primary"})
    but this keeps "btn"
